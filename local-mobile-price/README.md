- **Documentation**: In the "docs" folder, you will find additional documentation about the dataset, including data collection methods, data dictionary, and any preprocessing steps applied to the data.

## Dataset Information

The dataset is a result of community collaboration and aims to capture the diverse mobile phone market in Nigeria. By including both new and old phones, we hope to provide a comprehensive understanding of how prices vary based on factors such as age, brand, and specifications.

We encourage contributions from the community to enrich the dataset and improve its quality. If you have access to local pricing information or want to enhance the existing dataset, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Add your new data to the "Data" directory following the existing file structure.
3. If applicable, update or create Jupyter notebooks in the "Notebooks" directory to showcase your analysis using the new data.
4. Submit a pull request detailing the changes you've made. We'll review your contribution and merge it if it aligns with the repository's goals.
5. Engage in discussions, share insights, and collaborate with others in the Issues section.
